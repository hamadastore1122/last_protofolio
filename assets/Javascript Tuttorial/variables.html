    <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>  
    <div class="container">  
         
        <h2>By mohammed yahay | JavaScript</h2>  
        <p>Variables are used to store specific information that can be called up later.</p>  
        
        <h3>Do you remember algebra and math in school?</h3>  
        <p>For example, if you want to hold certain values like x = 5 and then this variable can be used with another letter like the previous example and the result is 11 or with another letter like the previous example and the result is 11 or with another letter like the previous example and the result is 11. Those letters are called variables and they are used to hold information (x = x + y).</p>  
        
        <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>  
        <p>Like algebra, JavaScript is used to collect values and expressions. Variables can be the letter x or a word such as carname.</p>  
        
        <h3>JavaScript Variable Naming Rules</h3>  
        <p>The variable name is case-sensitive, i.e., x is different from X. Variable names must begin with a letter, a $ sign, or an _ sign. Variable names cannot be written in Arabic only. They can be used with expressions in any language.</p>  
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because JavaScript is case sensitive, variables are also case sensitive.</p>  
        
        <h2>Create JavaScript Variables</h2>  
        <p>Creating variables in JavaScript often means declaring variables. You can declare a variable by putting the word var before the variable name.</p>  
        <h3>Example</h3>  
        <pre><code>var x;  
var carname;</code></pre>  
        
        <p>After creating the above code, you will need to add values to make the variables effective. Values can be placed in the variable and they can also be displayed.</p>  
        <h3>Example</h3>  
        <pre><code>var x = 5;  
var carname = "Mazda";</code></pre>  
        
        <p>After specifying the values for each of the variables, we specified the value 5 for the variable x and the value Mazda for the car name carname.</p>  
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using text as a value in the variable, you must use quotation marks around the value. The variable will not lose its value if it is not called.</p>  
        
        <h2>Local JavaScript Variables</h2>  
        <p>When a variable is used within a function, the variable is called a local variable, meaning it can only be used within the function code.</p>  
        <p>Local variables can only be used within function codes because local variables operate within function codes even if they are called from other specific functions. Local variables are canceled when you exit the function code.</p>  
        
        <h2>External JavaScript Variables Global</h2>  
        <p>When a variable is used outside the functional code, it is called an external variable, meaning that these variables can be called with all functional codes on the site.</p>  
        <p>External variables are canceled when the page is closed. When the word var is not used before the variable name, the variable will become external.</p>  
        
        <h2>Setting Values When JavaScript Variables Are Not Called</h2>  
        <p>When you specify a value without calling it, the variable will be called automatically as if it were an external variable.</p>  
        <pre><code>x = 5;  
carname = "Volvo";</code></pre>  
        
        <p>When these expressions x and carname are used without the var keyword they will become external variables (unless they are used before).</p>  
        
        <h2>Mathematical Equations and Calculations with JavaScript</h2>  
        <p>As in algebra, JavaScript variables can create equations and perform mathematical calculations.</p>
