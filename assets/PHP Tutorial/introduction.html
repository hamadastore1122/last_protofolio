        <p class="intro">PHP is a server-side programming language.</p>  

        <h2>History of PHP</h2>  
        <p>PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, Personal Home Page) is a scripting language designed primarily for use in developing and programming web applications. It can also be used to produce stand-alone programs that are not related to the web only. PHP is an open source language developed by a team of volunteers under the PHP license, supports object-oriented programming and its syntax is very similar to the syntax of the C language, in addition to it running on multiple operating systems such as Linux and Windows.</p>  

        <h2>PHP/FI</h2>  
        <p>PHP first appeared in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf. At the time, it was called PHP/FI. In fact, it was not a programming language at the time, but rather a set of applications written by the language. Rasmus created the applications Personal Home Page Tools, because he later needed more useful applications. Rasmus wrote a larger application using the same code, which allowed users to develop simple dynamic web applications.</p>  

        <h2>PHP 3</h2>  
        <p>In 1997, PHP/FI was rewritten by Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans after they found that PHP/FI 2.0 was not powerful enough to write an e-commerce application that they were working on as a graduation project for their university. They collaborated on the language that functioned as PHP 3.0 in the official version after PHP/FI. One of the most important features that distinguished PHP 3 from its predecessor is that it became extensible and allowed users to create their own libraries and add them to the language.</p>  

        <h2>PHP 4</h2>  
        <p>In 1998, shortly after the official launch of PHP 3.0, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans began rewriting the core of the language. The goal was to improve performance and larger programs and improve the language's stability.</p>  

        <h2>What should you know?</h2>  
        <p>Before starting with this language, you must be familiar with the following languages:</p>  
        <ul>  
            <li>HTML/XHTML</li>  
            <li>JavaScript</li>  
        </ul>  

        <h2>What is PHP language?</h2>  
        <p>PHP is an abbreviation for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side programming language like ASP. PHP codes are created and called on the server. PHP supports many databases such as MySQL, Informix, Oracle, Sybase, Solid PostgreSQL, and Generic ODBC. PHP is an open source programming language. PHP is free to download and use.</p>  

        <h2>What is a PHP file?</h2>  
        <p>A PHP file contains text, HTML tags, scripts, and other code. The result of the PHP code is displayed as plain text. .php, .phtml, .php3 are PHP file extensions.</p>  

        <h2>What is MySQL?</h2>  
        <p>MySQL is a database language. MySQL is an ideal language for both small and large applications. MySQL supports SQL language. MySQL supports a number of programming languages. MySQL is free to download and use.</p>  

        <h2>PHP + MySQL</h2>  
        <p>PHP is used with MySQL to create a platform and a base from which a local server can operate, and it can also work on Windows and also on Unix.</p>  

        <h2>Why PHP?</h2>  
        <p>PHP runs on different platforms and programs such as Windows, Linux, and Unix. PHP works on all types of servers currently in use such as Apache and IIS. PHP is free to use and download from the official website <a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a>. PHP is easy to learn and use and runs on server code.</p>  

        <h2>Where do you start?</h2>  
        <p>To obtain the authority to use a private server on the Internet, do the following:</p>  
        <p>Either install Apache on a personal server and install PHP and MySQL or find hosts that are ready and support PHP and MySQL.</p>
